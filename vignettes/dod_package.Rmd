## Purpose

This package was created as a tool to improve access to various types of oceanographic data from open sources. 

## Development 

Contributions to the `dod` package are welcome. The basic structure of each function involves finding a data source online to use as a `server` containing many files and constructing a `url` from which the function can download specific data.  

**eg** For BATS, the server and url are identified with:

	server <- "http://batsftp.bios.edu/BATS/ctd/ASCII/"
	url <- paste0(server, "b",ID, "_info.txt")
